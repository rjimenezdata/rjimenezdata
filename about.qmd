My name is **Ruben Jimenez (he/him/his)**, and I am a senior Statistics undergraduate at Cal Poly. I take great interest in mathematics, statistics, and finance. I built this website using Quarto both to brush up on the R skills I learned in class and to get more comfortable with `Markdown` and $\LaTeX$ syntaxes. Come with me as I figure out how to apply my specialized knowledge to personal interests.

## ðŸ“ˆ Cal Poly Stat Club Treasurer
Already being a two-year-long member of Cal Poly Stat Club, an official student chapter of the American Statistical Association, I was driven to run for treasurer by my desire to engage better with other members while improving membership quality. My platform promises to introduce more fundraising opportunities both big and small along with increased transparency in fund expenditure.
